Project Plan:

1. Collect Data
Collected states_daily and ethnicity_daily. Possible other data sets we can aggregate together with this?
Note: Could use the API and create 01-get_data.py.

2. Data Cleaning
01-clean_data.py

3. Analysis

Some interesting aggregate data. For example (more manual data collection) - scatterplot - overall, is there correlation between State (all states) total death count and their (GDP, population density, ethnicity). Is it significant (p-value) and explained (R^2)?

IDEA: General impact of COVID19

Drill down further . . . (refining the problem)

We focus on the analysis for approx. 5 States:

Inferential statistics (We answer the specific questions):
1. Does ethnicity impact the death rate?
2. Does sunlight/temperature impact the death rate?
3. Does ventalator impact the death rate? 

(i.e. hot topics from the general public)

Prediction:
Machine learning for predicting death rate 
classification of state (label)

DO THESE FEATURES (SUNLIGHT AND ETHNICITY HELP THE MODEL IN PREDICTION - COMPARE SCORES)
